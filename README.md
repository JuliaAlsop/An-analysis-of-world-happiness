Project 1: An Analysis of World Happiness 

Analyst Members: Tamela Allen, Julia Alsop, Carolina Miranda, & Anna Zhang

Project Proposal 
 
        What makes happy countries happy? This project is to examine the correlations between  different factors and the happiness index by comparing the happiness of people living in different regions or countries.  
Does weather and climate influence happiness? 
Does money equal happiness? 
Do citizens in happier countries tend to own their homes?
Do “happier countries” have lower suicide rate?  

  
       The research will present the means, standard deviations, and maximum and minimum values along with the correlation coefficients & linear regression between Happiness and the other measured variables; compare the U.S. with the top 3 happiest countries versus the top 3 unhappiest countries; utilize graphics to visualize the data. 

 Hypothesis: 

      Null Hypothesis H01: Happiness is not affected by weather.  
      Alternative Hypothesis HA1:  Happiness is affected by weather.
      Null Hypothesis H02:   People who live in higher GDP countries do not tend to be happier. 
      Alternative Hypothesis HA2:  People who live in higher GDP countries tend to be happier. 
      Null Hypothesis H03: Home ownership rate is not higher in “happier countries”. 
      Alternative Hypothesis HA3: Home ownership rate is higher in “happier countries ”.
      Null Hypothesis H04:  No interaction effect will be observed between the happiness index and suicide rate. 
      Alternative Hypothesis HA4: An interaction effect will be observed between the happiness index and suicide rate. 

Research Questions to answer: 
       
     R1:  Do people who live in sunshine states feel happier than those who are not?
     R2:  Do people who live in higher GDP countries happier than those who are not? 
     R3: Do people who  live  in higher home ownership rate countries happier than those who are not? 
     R4:  Do people who live in areas with a lower suicide rate happier than than those who are not?
