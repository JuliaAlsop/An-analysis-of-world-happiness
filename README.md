Project 1: An Analysis of First Time Home Buyers in Central Florida
Analyst Members: Tamela Allen, Julia Alsop, Carolina Miranda, & Anna Zhang

Proposal
	To analyze the trends of first time home buyers in central florida in relation to their age based on factors of income, gender, education, and marital status and how these factors may contribute to a younger or older first time home purchase. 
	Age will be categorized into different bins based on decades of 20-80yrs. in order to analyze the data more thoroughly in relation to the other variables. In addition bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots with linear regression will provide additional visual analysis necessary to interpret trends in the data.

Research Questions to answer/ Data Sets to be used 
	Which age group is more likely to be a first time home buyer & what factors contribute to this ? Does having a higher education contribute more to first time home buying or marriage status? Are education and income interrelated ? 
	Predicted data sets to be used include: 
		Statista (1st time home buyers all of U.S. 2003-2019)
		Zillow ; U.S. Census ; Trulia
